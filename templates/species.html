            <h2 id="two">Curcuma amada</h2>
            <p>Curcuma amada, or mango ginger,is a plant of the ginger family Zingiberaceae and is closely related to turmeric. The rhizomes are very similar to common ginger but have a raw mango taste.They are used in making pickles in south India and chutneys in north India. It is called mavina shunti in Kannada language. The taxonomy of the species is a subject of some confusion as some authorities have considered the name C. mangga as identical while others describe it as a distinct species with C. mangga being found in southern India while C. amada is of east Indian origin.</p>
            <h4>Medicinal research</h4>
            <p>Curcuma mangga extracts have shown cytotoxic activities on the human cancer cell lines MCF-7 (a hormone-dependent breast cell line), KB (a nasopharyngeal epidermoid cell line), A549 (a lung cell line), Ca Ski (a cervical cell line), and HT-29 (a colon cell line). The extracts showed no cytotoxicity against the non-cancerous human fibroblast cell line MRC-5.</p>

        <p>Curcuma angustifolia is one species belonging to the genus Curcuma ,in the family Zingiberaceae. This species is native to the Indian subcontinent and is more commonly known as East Indian arrowroot or narrow-leaved turmeric in English, and is called "yaipan" in Manipuri, "Aipah" in Thadou-Kuki, "tikhur" in Hindi, and "Koova" കൂവ in Malayalam, and is called "Kutupah" in Poula. In the Eastern hemisphere, the plant plays an integral role in many cultures.
        
        <h4>Distribution</h4>
        <p>C. angustifolia is most commonly found growing wild in India, especially in the northeast and western coastal plains and hills. Such areas include the states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Orissa (Odisha), Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala. This species can also be found in Burma, Laos, Nepal, and Pakistan.</p>
        
        <h4>Medicinal Uses</h4>
        <p>The rhizomes of C. angustifolia are used to soothe coughs and as such is used to treat bronchitis.Essential oils from C. angustifolia have been extracted and are used in antifungal medications.Compounds in the leaves of this plant have also been shown to have potential as antibacterial agents.In addition, scientists have extracted the starches within the flour produced by the ground rhizomes of C. angustifolia and compared it to corn starch. Its binding and disintegration properties make it a viable, and perhaps superior, substitute for cornstarch as an excipient in medicinal tablets.</p>

        <h2 id="four">Curcuma aromatica</h2>
        <p>Curcuma aromatica (common name: wild turmeric) is a member of the genus Curcuma belonging to the family Zingiberaceae. Botanically close to Curcuma australasica, wild turmeric has been widely used as a cosmetic herbal in South Asia and nearby regions.</p>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>The wild turmeric is one among the 80 members of the plant family Zingiberaceae. The perennial foliage dies down in late autumn and the rhizomes remain dormant in winter. The inflorescence appears in early spring from the base of the rhizomes. During summer monsoon season and the immediately following weeks, the plant grows fast and vigorously. The stalk grows to about 20–30 centimetres (7.9–11.8 in) tall, and is crowned with enlarged coloured bracts with pink tips. Leaves often appear even after the flowers. When in full growth the plants can reach a height of about 40 cm (16 in) tall.</p>
        <h4>Habitat</h4>
        <p>This species is found in the south Asian region, predominantly in eastern Himalayas and in the warm forests of the Western Ghats (India).</p>
        <h4>Uses</h4>
        <p>Wild turmeric has rhizomes with a peculiar fragrance and cream color. The rhizomes are often used in cosmetic herbal medicines and as a culinary ingredient in limited quantities as a food flavor. Leaves are broad and very decorative, elliptic with a leaf stem running as long to the tip of the blade. A fresh stalk with flowers and leaves, cut to proper size and shape, can be used as a floral indoor decoration in vase for up to 10 days.</p>

        <h2 id="five">Curcuma australasica</h2>
        <p>Curcuma australasica, the native turmeric or Cape York lily, is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial plant of the Zingiberaceae or ginger family.</p>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Curcuma australasica is the only Australian native of the 100 or more species of Curcuma found world-wide. It occurs on Cape York Peninsula in Queensland, a few areas in the Northern Territory and in Papua New Guinea. It is typically found growing in moist pockets in sandstone areas, and in wet woodland and forest areas. It grows well in containers where it is often cultivated for its very beautiful, long-lasting flower. C. australasica can be propagated by division, and prefers to be well-watered in summer and allowed to dry in winter, in correspondence with Monsoonal patterns.It is grown for its flowers in Zimbabwe, and a cultivated variety called "Aussie Plume" is grown in the US which can grow up to 6 ft (almost 2 metres) tall.The native form is usually less than 500 mm (20 in) tall, with long green leaves (140-450 x 60–190 mm), pleated. Flowers 15–20 mm, November to March in Queensland, normally yellow on a spike with pink, red, mauve or green bracts.</p>

        <h2 id="six">Curcuma caesia</h2>
        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <p>The cultivation and harvest practices are similar to that of common turmeric.In the fields, the rhizomes are washed thoroughly and are placed in a wide mouthed cauldron. The water is poured in the cauldron such that the rhizomes are completely covered. The cauldron is covered with a lid, and the rhizomes are boiled for about 30 minutes until foam oozes out with a strong odour. The rhizomes are taken out when the water is reduced to one-third of the original and they are soft and their inner portion has turned from blue to dark or pale brown. The rhizomes are then dried in hot sun for 10 to 15 days until hardened. These dried rhizomes are then packed for marketing.</p>
        <h4>Chemical constituents</h4>
        <p>The research on the volatile rhizomes oil of Curcuma caesia resulted in the identification of 30 components, representing 97% of the oil, with camphor (28%), ar-turmerone (12%), (Z)-ocimene (8%), ar-curcumene (7%), 1,8-cineole (5%), elemene (5%), borneol (4%), bornyl acetate (3%) and curcumene (3%) as the major constituents.Other research demonstrated diphenylalkanoids, phenylpropene derivatives, terpenoids, flavonoids, steroids, and alkaloids as major constituents.</p>

        <h2 id="seven">Curcuma comosa</h2>
        <p>Curcuma comosa is a species of flowering plant in the ginger family. It is native to much of Asia, including Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia.The herb is cultivated in Thailand, especially in the Northern Province, including Petchaboon, and the Northeastern Province, including Loei. Curcuma comosa is widely used as a traditional herbal remedy.</p>
        <h4>Uses</h4>
        <p>This medicinal plant is used for its anti-inflammatory properties in the treatment of postpartum uterine bleeding and uterine inflammation. Research suggests that Curcuma comosa extract possesses a strong anti-inflammatory activity and has a potential to be developed as a therapeutic compound for diverse neurological disorders associated with inflammation.Thai traditional practitioners use the rhizome of C. comosa in the treatment of women for the alleviation of postpartum uterine pain, the enhancement of uterine involution and the reduction of uterine inflammation after delivery.Numerous studies have been conducted on the effects of C. comosa showing that it can reduce blood cholesterol,increase the thickness of epithelial cells lining the vagina,and decrease uterine smooth muscle contraction.The plant is also used to repair vaginal wall prolapse, tighten vaginal muscles, and relieve premenstrual syndrome and cramping. It has been used for centuries in Thailand as a remedy for many other gynecological problems including vaginal dryness, hot flashes, excessive white and yellow vaginal discharge, bad odor, and irregular, excessive, or absent menstrual cycles.[citation needed] It appears to increase the effect of ovarian and testicular hormones, and may have an estrogenic effect.It is used in Thai luxury spas to lift sagging muscles, promote circulation, and provide good health and glowing skin.</p>

        <h2 id="eight">Curcuma longa</h2>
        <p>Turmeric has been used in Asia for thousands of years and is a major part of Ayurveda, Siddha medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, Unani,and the animistic rituals of Austronesian peoples.It was first used as a dye, and then later for its supposed properties in folk medicine.The greatest diversity of Curcuma species by number alone is in India, at around 40 to 45 species. Thailand has a comparable 30 to 40 species for example, but is much smaller than India. Other countries in tropical Asia also have numerous wild species of Curcuma. Recent studies have also shown that the taxonomy of Curcuma longa is problematic, with only the specimens from South India being identifiable as C. longa. The phylogeny, relationships, intraspecific and interspecific variation, and even identity of other species and cultivars in other parts of the world still need to be established and validated. Various species currently utilized and sold as "turmeric" in other parts of Asia have been shown to belong to several physically similar taxa, with overlapping local names.</p>
